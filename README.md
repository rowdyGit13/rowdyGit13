### About Me

I'm a materials scientist and engineer by trade. I got my PhD in chemical engineering and I currently work as an applications engineer on automated semiconductor metrology tools. I picked up programming on the side during my PhD and have continued to learn and use it ever since. I'm now looking to transition into a career in software development.

### My Projects

I'm currently working on a few projects.
